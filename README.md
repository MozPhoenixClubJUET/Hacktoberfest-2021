<h3 align="center">Welcome to Hacktoberfest@JUET 2021!</h3>
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software, run by DigitalOcean and supported by Intel, DeepSource, Appwrite and many more.
Submit 4 valid pull requests and aside from the knowledge you’ll gain (and the fun you’ll have), you’ll receive some amazing swags and a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt. This year, you can choose to go green by getting a tree planted instead of opting for a T-shirt and swags.
